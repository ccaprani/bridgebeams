# bridgebeams
Provides Australian bridge beams for use with the `sectionproperties` package.

Refer to the `examples.py` file for usage.


## Note on units
The package requires the use of millimetres (mm) for the input of geometric dimensions and reports the results accordingly (i.e. mm3, mm4, etc). This is because the dictionary of the standard dimensions is hard coded in mm.

Users interested in inputting and obtaining properties in other units (e.g. metres, inches) will have to perform the appropriate unit conversions for both input and output.
